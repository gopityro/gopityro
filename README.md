A test to host git repository on netlify.

How to make your github repository live on network ?

Here I am taking help of netlify.com.

step1: Add your project repository to github.
step2: login to netlify.com
step3: Autenticate netlify to access your github repositories.
step4: Pick you site from github repositories.
step5: Deploy site.

Changes to your github repository will directly reflect on netlify.
