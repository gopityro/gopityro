Guide: Hosting Your GitHub Repository on Netlify**

1. **Creating Your GitHub Repository**: Start by setting up your project on GitHub. Ensure it's well-structured and includes all necessary files for deployment.

2. **Accessing Netlify**: Sign in to your Netlify account. If you don't have one, sign upâ€”it's free and straightforward.

3. **Authorizing GitHub Access**: Navigate to the "Settings" section in your Netlify dashboard. Find the "Access" tab and authorize Netlify to access your GitHub repositories. This step establishes a secure connection between GitHub and Netlify.

4. **Selecting Your Project**: Once authorization is complete, go back to the main dashboard. Click on the "New site from Git" button. Choose GitHub as your Git provider and select the repository you want to deploy.

5. **Configuring Deployment Settings**: Netlify will automatically detect the settings for your project. You can customize the build command and publish directory if needed. Ensure everything is set up correctly before proceeding.

6. **Initiating Deployment**: Click on the "Deploy site" button to start the deployment process. Netlify will fetch your code from GitHub, build your site, and deploy it automatically. This may take a few moments depending on the size of your project and your internet connection speed.

7. **Monitoring Deployment Progress**: Once deployment begins, you can monitor the progress in real-time on the Netlify dashboard. Any errors or warnings will be displayed, allowing you to address them promptly.

8. **Site Deployment Completion**: Once deployment is successful, Netlify will provide you with a unique URL for your site. You can visit this URL to see your project live on the web.

9. **Continuous Deployment**: Netlify offers continuous deployment, meaning any changes you push to your GitHub repository will trigger automatic updates to your live site on Netlify. This ensures that your site is always up-to-date without manual intervention.

Congratulations! You've successfully hosted your GitHub repository on Netlify. Your project is now accessible to the world.
